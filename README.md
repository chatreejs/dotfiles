# Chatree.js's "Dotfiles"

Hi, there! 👋

I'm Chatree.js, a 25 years old Senior GIS Application Developer from Thailand

This repository **Dotfiles** contain my personal config files. Here you'll find configs, customizations, themes, and whatever I need to personalize my Linux and mac OS experience.

> ⚠️ Be aware, products can change over time. I do my best to keep up with the latest changes and releases, but please understand that this won’t always be the case.
